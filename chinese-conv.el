;;; Commentary:

;; This file works with opencc (http://code.google.com/p/opencc/)
;; and/or cconv (http://code.google.com/p/cconv)

;; Put this file into your load-path and the following into your
;; ~/.emacs:
;;   (require 'chinese-conv)

;; Commands `chinese-conv' and `chinese-conv-replace' can be used
;; interactively or non-interactively.

;;; Changelog:

;; 2016/02/17
;;     * Opencc backend data path now customizable through
;;       `chinese-conv-opencc-data'
;;
;; 2015/02/26
;;     * Opencc backend update for its JSON configuration files
;;
;; 2013/02/13
;;     * New feature: multiple backend.
;;       Customizable through `chinese-conv-backend'.
;;       Built-in support for opencc and cconv. More backends
;;       can be added through `chinese-conv-backend-alist'
;;     * New Command: `chinese-conv-replace'
;;     * API change: `chinese-conv'
